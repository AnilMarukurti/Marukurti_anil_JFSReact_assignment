                <h2>Here's a time line of ms Dhoni life: </h2>
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li><strong>July 7, 1981 -</strong>Born in Ranchi on 7 july 1981 </li>
                    <li><strong>December 23, 2004 -</strong> He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.</li>
                    <li><strong>April 5, 2005 -</strong> The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash 148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's 356/9. The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>October 31, 2005 -</strong> Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record 183* against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in the best-of-seven series.</li>
                    <li><strong>September 24, 2007 -</strong> He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the CB Series of 2007â€“08,.</li>
                    <li><strong>April 2, 2011 -</strong>India win the World Cup after 28 years, with the skipper hitting the winning runs with a six. Promoting himself up the order, Dhoni shrugs off his poor run in the tournament with the innings of his life: 91* off 79 balls.</li>
                    <li><strong>June 23, 2013 -</strong>Dhoni marshals his troops superbly to lead India to a narrow five-run win in the final of the Champions Trophy over hosts England, thus becoming the first captain to hold all three of the ICC's major titles.</li>
                    <li><strong>March 23, 2016 -</strong>Dhoni's coolness and ability to back players under immense pressure is to the fore in Bangalore, where Bangladesh are beaten by one run during the World Twenty20. Dhoni helps India pull off an incredible heist.</li>
                    <li><strong>January 4, 2017 -</strong>Announces that he is giving up the captaincy, but remains available for selection for the upcoming England series.</li>
                    <li><strong>9 July 2019 -</strong>Dhoni played his last ODI match against newzealand in ICC CWC.</li>
                    <li><strong>15 August 2020 -</strong>Dhoni announced retirement from international cricket.</li>
